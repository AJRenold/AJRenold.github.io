Welcome! This is the home of my blog. I'll be using this blog this semester (Fall of 2013) 
to blog about a couple of classes and projects that I am working on. I'm creating this blog 
with the help of [Jekyll][jekyll] and running it with [Github pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) 
to have some fun learning about these technologies. I'll also be using [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for 
the first time to author blog posts!
